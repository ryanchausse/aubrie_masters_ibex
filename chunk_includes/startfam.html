<h3>Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Please do not judge the content or plausibility of the scenario when selecting your rating.</li>
    <br />
    <li>Assume that both of the people in the conversation meant to write what they sent. While typos and autocorrect mistakes are common in texting, please do not consider this possibility as an explanation or justification for what you see.</li>
    <br />
    <li>This study is not about rules you find in a grammar book, but about how language is actually used in everyday life.</li>
    <br />
    <li>Imagine the conversations were taking place between family members, coworkers, or friends of yours. Would you consider both of the people in the conversation native speakers (then the conversation is natural) or does one or both of the people sound somehow 'strange'?</li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <p>
    Remember, this practice session is only to permit you to become comfortable with the experiment style and technology. These responses are not recorded.
