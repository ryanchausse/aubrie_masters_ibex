    You will see a series of conversations taking place on WhatsApp. Select a rating on the scale of 1-7 indicating how <strong>natural</strong> the conversation seems. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We are interested in your <strong> reaction </strong> to the conversations. This is <strong>not an evaluation of your English level. </strong> We simply want to know how you would react if you saw the conversation happening in the real world. 
  </p>

    Remember, this practice session is only to permit you to become comfortable with the experiment style and technology. These responses are not recorded.
